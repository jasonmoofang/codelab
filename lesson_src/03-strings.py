"This is a string!"
"Bob says: \"this is a string with escaped quotes!\""

# Like numbers, strings don't do anything on their own.
# We can also print strings:
print "This will appear on your screen!"
print "With \"escaped characters\" and all!"

# This is an erroneous string:
# "Onoes! I forgot to "escape"!"

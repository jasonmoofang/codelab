		<h1>Why Coding? </h1>
		<h4>Coding is not a fad. It’s an essential skill that the youth of the digital age need. Here’s why.</h4>
		<h3>What most schools don’t teach</h3>

			“Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just
			want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn”

		<h4>The Value of Coding</h4>
		<p>
		Coding is not the solution to a problem. Coding is a tool which helps us
		<strong>solve problems and create things</strong>. Sometimes, pretty awesome things.
		Like <a href="http://www.angrybirds.com/">Angry Birds</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Coding at its core is the way we <strong>speak to computers</strong>.
		How we give a computer instructions. Think about the world in 20 years. We’ll be
		sitting in driverless cars and moving objects with our mind. The one skill you had
		better have is to be able to <strong>read and write code.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		Unless you intend to be a mountain hermit, <strong>technology</strong> will be
		present in your life one way or another. Don’t just be a consumer of technology.
		<strong>Understand it. Learn how to control it.</strong>

			There just aren’t enough people who are trained and have these skills today”

		<h4>The Codelab Mantra</h4>
		<p>
		Here at Codelab, we don’t believe in accepting the <strong>status quo</strong>.
		We want to <strong>challenge</strong> it. To build <strong>disruptive</strong> technologies.
		To <strong>innovate</strong>. To change our lives and that of those around us.
		And it all starts with a <strong>single line of code</strong>.
		</p>
		<h4>Some thoughts to take away:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Did you know that <strong>9 out of 10</strong> of the top paying companies for interns are technology companies?</li>
			<li>
			In the US, computer science is the <strong>top paying college degree</strong> and computer programming
			jobs are <strong>growing at 2X the national average.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>The World Bank has highlighted <strong>IT, language and communication</strong> as the skills most in
			<strong>deficit</strong> among Malaysian firms in National Key Economic Areas (NKEAS)
			</li>
		</ul>
